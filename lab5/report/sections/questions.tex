%Include answers to the inline questions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item %1. Assuming a functionally correct system running at a 100 MHz clock, can you derive a theoretical bound for the scalability of the 44.1KHz â†’ 48KHz sampling rate converter?
	\item %2. What is the maximum scalability achieved by your design? (HINT: This may be different from the five scalability factors you are asked to demonstrate.)
	\item %3. Justify whether all output streams meet their throughput requirement of 48 KHz
\end{enumerate}
