%Explain functional correctness of your Verilog programs (include your complete Verilog programs in an appendix).
%Explain #clock cycles per sample time Ts. Include waveforms.
%Report, analyze & explain FPGA-resource usage and utilization {#multipliers, #BRAMS, #LUTs} in relation to your design.
%Report, analyze & explain (min) sample time Ts and (max) sample frequency fs, both after synthesis and after placement & routing.
Appendix~\ref{app:source} gives the Verilog implementation for the filter.

\paragraph{Resource usage}
Our resource usage, as given by the synthesis report, is as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}

%TODO: Resource explanation

The multiplexers are due to the way we access the wires.

The synthesis report gives us the following values.
\begin{description}
	\item[Minimum period]
	\item[Maximum frequency]
\end{description}

The report after the placement \& routing step gives us the following values.
\begin{description}
	\item[Minimum period]
	\item[Maximum frequency]
\end{description}
