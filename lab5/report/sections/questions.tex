%Include answers to the inline questions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item %1. Assuming a functionally correct system running at a 100 MHz clock, can you derive a theoretical bound for the scalability of the 44.1KHz â†’ 48KHz sampling rate converter?
		If we could compute a value in one cycle, we would theoretically be able to reach $100MHz/48kHz \approx 2083$ streams.
	\item %2. What is the maximum scalability achieved by your design? (HINT: This may be different from the five scalability factors you are asked to demonstrate.)
		Since we need two cycles to compute each value, we can only reach $1041$ streams.
	\item %3. Justify whether all output streams meet their throughput requirement of 48 KHz
		We were not able to run our design on the board succesfully.
		Using the real-time environment, our filter produced only silence.
		The offline environment did not compile, throwing an unspecified error that said to contact support.
		Unfortunately, the instructors were not able to find the root of the error, and we did not have enough time to implement a work-around.

		We were able to succesfully simulate 2, 32, 128, 256 and 512 streams.
		Using our theoretical bound, 1024 streams should also work for our design, but we did not have enough time to complete that simulation.
