    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:    454
      Number with same-slice register load:    393
      Number with same-slice carry load:        61
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,312 out of   6,822   19%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                     4,056 out of  13,644   29%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,927
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,767 out of   4,927   76%

    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         402 out of   4,927    8%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
