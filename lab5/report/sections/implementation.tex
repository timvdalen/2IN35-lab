\paragraph{Resource usage}
Our resource usage, as given by the synthesis report, is as follows.

It seems like our design is not using the BRAM, even though we followed the guidelines.
However, since the design is fast enough, that is not much of a problem.
As expected, we use 4 multipliers for the computation.

The multiplexers are due to the way we access the wires.

The synthesis report gives us the following values.
\begin{description}
	\item[Minimum period] 8.450ns
	\item[Maximum frequency] 118.341MHz
\end{description}

The report after the placement \& routing step gives us the following values.
\begin{description}
	\item[Minimum period] 9.695ns
	\item[Maximum frequency] 103.146MHz
\end{description}
