%Analyze the specifications and requirements.

In this assignment, we will implement a signal scaler.
A scaler is used to convert between sample rates.

Specifcally, we will implement a scaler that will upscape from a sample rate of 44.1kHz to a sample rate of 48kHz.

Scalers can be implemented in multiple ways.
First of all, we can implement a scaler directly, which does the entire transformation in one component.
Another option is to chain together multiple smaller scalers to achieve the same end result.

Inside each scaler, we have a choice between directly implementing the equation for the scaler as a function, or using a composite design that consists of an upscaler, a low-pass filter and a downscaler.
