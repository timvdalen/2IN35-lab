%Analyze the specifications and requirements.
In this assignment, we will extend our scaler from assignment 4 with the possibility of simultaneously up-sampling a number of different input streams.
We will scale the input from 44.1kHz to 48kHz.

Our filter should be able to handle as much streams as possible.

Specifically, our requirements are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The sample rate of the output must be $\frac{160}{147}$ times the sample rate of the input.
	\item The output must be a resampled version of the input (meaning that they should sound the same).
	\item The filter must support an input sample rate of at least 44.1kHz.
	\item To run on the board, we need to make sure that the filter we design is able to run with a clock frequency of at least 100MHz.
	\item The top-level Verilog module of our implementation must be called \texttt{filter} to work with the rest of the environment.
	\item The filter must be scalable: by setting a parameter for the filter, we can vary the number of input streams the filter works with.
\end{itemize}
