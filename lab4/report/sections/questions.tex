%Include answers to the inline questions

\begin{enumerate}
	\item %1. Verify the direct equation for y[n]
	\item %2. The equation for y[n] uses different coefficients for each output y[n], however the pattern of coefficients repeats. What is the period of this pattern?
	\item %3. Examine for each of the the four possible designs: The number of multiplications performed per output. The total number of coefficients required. The highest sample rate inside the system
\end{enumerate}
